## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - `tkinter` (standard with Python)
  - `googletrans==4.0.0-rc1`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python srt_translator.py
   ```
2. Click `Browse` to select your `.srt` file.
3. Choose the target language from the dropdown.
4. Click `Translate` to start the translation.
5. View the progress and estimated time.
6. Click `Stop` if you want to cancel and save what is done.
7. Save the translated file when prompted.

## How it Works
- The tool reads your `.srt` file and auto-detects the source language.
- It translates block-by-block while preserving time codes.
- Translation progress is tracked with a live progress bar.
- The "Stop" button interrupts the translation loop safely and saves the partial results.

## Limitations
- `googletrans` uses an unofficial API and may occasionally fail or be rate-limited.
- The quality of translation depends on the Google Translate service.
- Large `.srt` files may result in slower processing.
